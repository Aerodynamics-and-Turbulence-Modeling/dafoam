DAFoam supports Linux and MacOS systems, it does not supports Windows at this moment. 

For new users, we recommend using the pre-compiled version of the DAFoam optimization package.

The pre-compiled version works for both Linux (Ubuntu, Centos, etc.) and MacOS, and is available on Docker Hub.

To get the pre-compiled DAFoam package, download this script:

initDAFoam

startDAFoam

If you want to run DAFoam on a HPC system, you need to compile it from the source.

The source code for the DAFoam packages is available at:


Follow the instructions in the Installation section to use/compile DAFoam.
